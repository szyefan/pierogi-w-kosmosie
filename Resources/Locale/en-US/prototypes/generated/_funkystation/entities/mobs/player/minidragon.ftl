    .desc = It's a mini dragon, sometimes also known as a poodle dragon. These small and suprisingly hardy space dragons are not actually baby dragons, but are closely related to full sized dragons. While friendlier than your average dragon, they tend to have eccentric personalities and a penchant for greed to match their draconic ancestry.
